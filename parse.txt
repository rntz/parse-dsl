Names x ::=
Exprs e ::= # just use racket expressions

Patterns
    p ::= x
        | _
        | {fp,*}            # record pattern
        | "[" p,* "]"       # list pattern
        | "[" p,* "|" p "]" # list pattern with tail

Field patterns
   fp ::= x | x : p

Parsers
NB. this is essentially a very dense monad comprehension syntax!
    v ::= v "|" v                   # alternation
        | p:v_1 v_2                 # matches p against result of v_1 and runs v_2
        | v_1 v_2                   # runs v_1 then v_2, giving results of v_2
        | -> e                      # pure/return
        | if e                      # guard
        | (v)                       # parentheses for precedence
        | case v_1 ("|" p -> v)*    # case analysis
        | error e
        | v* | v+
        # is this (optional v)? or (option Nothing (Just <$> v))? or what?
        | v?

        # Bundles all bound variables in v into a dict.
        # eg. {x:int y:int} parses "0 2" into dict {x: 0, y: 2}
        # not convinced of the utility of this.
        | {v}

Open question: how to allow use of parser-combinators/meta-operators?

Note that
    (x:int int)*
should warn about unused variable x, and:
    (x:int int)* -> x
should complain that x isn't in scope.

# OLD VERSION

Value parsers
this is just monadic parser-combinator land!
    v ::= {r}               # embeds a record parser r
        | v "|" v           # alternation
        | "[" v,* "]"       # concatenation into a list/tuple. not sure about this one.
        | "[" v,* "|" v "]" # listing with tail
        | e @ v             # function application (unary)
        | e @ "(" v,* ")"   # function application (multi-argument)

        # is this obsoleted by "r if e" form?
        | v ? e             # result x of v if (e x)

        # TODO: monadic pure, ap, bind, join
        | pure v
        | let p = v_1 in v_2
        | case v_1 ("|" p -> v)*
        | join v
        | error e

        # NB: requires unbounded lookahead!
        # inline function application / let-binding
        # eg. (x:int y:int [x + y])
        | r "[" e "]"
        | r -> e            # alternate syntax

        # just gives back string matched
        | regex(e)          # string matched by regex e
        | regex(e_1, e_2)   # group e_2 of string matched by regex e_1

Record parsers
TODO: use patterns instead of variable names
    r ::= p : v             # matches pattern p against result of v
        | r_1 r_2           # take record-union of r_1, r_2; requires disjoint names
        | r_1 "|" r_2       # r_1 & r_2 must define same set of names?
        | r if e            # r if e holds (fields of r are bound in e)

        # "iteration" of record r
        # (x:int y:int)* parses "2 3 4 5" into {x: [2,4], y: [3,5]}
        | r*

Maybe two parser formats, an "auto-record" version and an auto-tuple version?

xs:(a:int b:int)*

a:int b:int [a + b]

----------
Problem: operator precedence

----------
Simple calculator:

    digit = regex [0-9]
    number = ds:digit* -> to_int(ds)

    expr = number
         | x:expr o:oper y:expr -> o(x,y)
         | "(" e:expr ")" -> e

    oper = + [(+)] | * [(*)] | - [(-)] | / [(/)]

----------
Idea: could base an entire language on parsing & pattern-matching
parsing = study of pattern-matching on streams/lists
arguments are given in *lists*

even = 0 [ 0 ]
     | Suc(Suc(x:even)) [ Suc(x) ]

even {
  0 -> 0
  S(S(x:even)) -> S(x)
}
